    This is a paragraph in my first html file. I'm not sure what to put so I will summarize how to get started with github and go over some basic commands. Make an account on github and create a new repository. Copy the link for it. On your local computer, create a folder/directory and go into it using the command terminal.  Do git clone (repository link) to get the repository on your local machine.  Git add (file) stages the file, and then it can be committed. Git commit -m (message) records the changes. Git push updates the files on the website.  Git status tells you if your branch is up to date.
